# Foxhole-streamer-overlay-script
A quick and dirty script for a friend to automatically cover the map in foxhole with an overlay in OBS (or your choice of streaming software) to prevent data leaks.

Instructions/info you should know:
- To use this script you must install AutoHotKey
- Line 10 should be the window title of foxhole. For a new notepad this would be "Untitled - Notepad". Failure to match will result in the script not working.
- you must configure your streaming software overlay to have "F8" as the keybind to toggle your overlay, or define your own keybind in the script at lines 42, 44, 47, 49, 59, and 61. 




Disclaimer: I have not played, nor do I own Foxhole. This was done for a friend, and as a prototype for a version two that would support a two machine setup with game rig/stream rig (which is on hold until I know if version one works at all). This script may or may not work, as the friend it was written for has moved on from the game, and has not told me anything about the way the game functions. This script was written how I expect the game to behave, and the only testing performed was done in notepad. This testing has shown the script to act the way I intend it to, assuming the game behaves the way I expect it to. Scripting blind is hard, sorry. I will however happily provide support to get it working in the event that it does not function.
